When editing content in Perch, an editor might like to check their work before publishing to the site.

They can do this before saving by checking the **Save as a draft**
checkbox.

When working in a draft his is highlighted by a bar across the top of the editor. You can Preview your work by clicking Preview. This will launch the relevant page in a new window or tab so you can check.

## Undo

You can also click Undo to revert changes that you have made. This gives content editors confidence when editing their content that they are not about to make a mistake that is irreversible.

We find that when content editors know they can step back if things go wrong, they are more likely to have confidence in editing their own content â€“ leading to fewer calls to their web designer for help!
