You can easily brand Perch with your own branding or that of your client. If you manage several Perch sites it can be helpful if the admin is branded so you know which site you are logging into!

## Logo and colours

In Settings upload a logo. This will then display on the light gray sidebar in the admin and also above the login box.

You can also change the colour of the header bar and switch the text if you are using a dark colour.

## Remove Perch branding

If you would rather hide the fact you are using Perch then check “Hide Perch Branding”. That will remove mention of Perch and hide the link to edgeofmyseat.com.

## More extensive customization

We have an official way for you to import your own CSS and JavaScript into the admin. This means you will not need to redo your changes when upgrading. See [UI Customizations](/docs/customizing-perch/ui-customizations/) for more details.
