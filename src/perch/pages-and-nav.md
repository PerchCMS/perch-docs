A CMS doesn't only deal with the content you create, it typically manages the structure of your site as well. Perch was designed as a 'drop in' CMS for static sites and so our page management functionality reflects this goal. We aim to make it easy to give management abilities to editors for sections of your site and content.

If you would prefer the CMS took over all management of the site architecture Perch Runway would be a much better fit for that project - you'll get all the excellent structured content creation of Perch plus full page creation and management across your site.
