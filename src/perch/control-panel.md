We aim to make the Perch Control Panel as easy to use and also as configurable as possible. Weâ€™ve all had to deal with CMS Administration Panels cluttered with tools that we never use.

This section of the documentation introduces various features of the Control Panel.

Here we also demonstrate some of the ways you can tailor the Control Panel for your content editors so they can get the work they need to do there done quickly.
