You can see which version of Perch you are running by looking at your Diagnostics Report. The report also lists the versions of any Apps you have installed.

Specific upgrade instructions for each dot release upgrade can be found on the page detailing that release. [View the latest release notes](https://grabaperch.com/update/).

Most updates simply require you to replace the core folder, found within the `perch` folder (or whatever you have renamed it to). However do check the update notes first.

We work very hard to ensure that updates do not cause any problems, but as a matter of good practice we would always suggest that you **take a backup** of files and database before updating â€“ just in case something goes wrong.

## Upgrading from Perch 1 to Perch 2

We no longer support upgrades from Perch 1 to Perch 2. Perch 1 reached end-of-life in May 2015. In many cases you can still upgrade a version 1 site to Perch 2, [read the full instructions](/perch/building/updating/from-perch1/).
