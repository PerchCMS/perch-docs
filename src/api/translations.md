As Perch supports multiple languages, apps too have the ability to do so. Language files are created in `perch/addons/apps/my_app/lang`. 

During development of your app you should:

- Make sure the lang folder inside your app is writable by PHP
- Set the Perch language setting to match the default language your appâ€™s interface instructions are written in

As you create your app, text strings from the interface will be added to a new translation file inside the lang folder.

Strings passed through `PerchAPI_HTML` and `PerchAPI_Form` are automatically added to the translation. If you write anything to the page directly, you should pass the string through `PerchAPI_Lang::get()`.

```php
$Lang = $API->get('Lang');
echo $Lang->get('Welcome to my app');
```

The [Lang API reference](/api/reference/lang) has full details of how the languages functions can be used.
