This section of the documentation deals with the Page Functions that relate to listing and displaying Bookings made through your events.

## After an booking is placed

Once a successful booking is placed, we store the information about this Booking. This will appear in the Perch Control Panel under Bookings.

You can also display information about the Booking a Customer has made on your site. This enables the creation of a list of "My Bookings" in a Customer Account.
