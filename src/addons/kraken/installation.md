[Download the app](http://grabaperch.com/add-ons/apps/kraken) checking that your installation of Perch is equal to or greater than the minimum version listed.

Unzip the download and copy the `addons/apps/perch_kraken` folder into

```php
/perch/addons/apps/
```

As this is an admin only app there is no runtime to include. The app will then show up in the admin menu as Kraken.

## Settings

Before you can use the service you need to [sign up](https://kraken.io/?ref=5a608b00df18) and get an API key. Free accounts are available so you can test the service before needing to pay.

Once you have your API key and secret, enter these on the Settings page and save.

Kraken works on a request and callback basis, so **your site needs to be online and publicly accessible** for the optimized images to be retrieved.
