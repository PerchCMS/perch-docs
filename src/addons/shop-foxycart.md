**This app is now deprecated.** For new installations, please use the [Shop app](/addons/shop/) instead.

The FoxyShop app enables you to sell products from your site using the
third party cart and checkout service, FoxyCart. You need to set up an
account on [FoxyCart](http://www.foxycart.com/) to use this app.

The app provides the ability to add categories and products, with forms
which submit to the cart on FoxyCart.

The shop manages inventory in a basic manner, each product has a
quantity field and after purchase we use the xml datafeed from FoxyCart
to decrease the available number.

The shop also allows you to set the FoxyCart category on each item which
is how you manage taxes and delivery on items in FoxyCart, as well as
alternative product types such as downloads.

Before using this app you should familiarize yourself with how FoxyCart
works, this is essentially a helper app to enable listing and stock
control of products sold via FoxyCart.
