The Twitter app enables you to cache and display Tweets and Favorites
from Twitter on your site.

## Additional server requirements

The Twitter app requires that your hosting has the PHP cURL
functionality installed and also that cURL is not blocked at the
firewall.

If you wish tweets to update automatically you will also need the
ability to run a cron job or scheduled task on your server. Otherwise we
have no way to automatically update your tweets.
