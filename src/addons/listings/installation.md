Download the latest version of the Listings App checking that the minimum version of Perch is the same or less than the version of Perch that you are running.

Unzip the download where you will find two folders.

-   `listings` – which contains example pages
-   `perch_listings` – which is the actual app

Copy the `perch_listings` folder into `perch/addons/apps/`

Add `perch_listings` [to your apps.php file](/docs/installing-perch/installing-apps/).

When you next log into the Perch admin the Listings install script will run behind the scenes to create the necessary tables. A new listings navigation item will appear in the administration menu.
