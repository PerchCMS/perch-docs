This section of the documentation deals with the Page Functions and Template Tags that relate to listing and displaying Orders made through your shop. As with everything in Perch this information is fully templateable so you can display invoices, payment receipts and other information about the orders that a customer has made.

## After an order is placed

Once a successful order is placed, we store the information about this Order. This will appear in the Perch Control Panel under Orders.

You can also display information about the Orders a Customer has made on your site. This enables the creation of a list of "My Orders" in a Customer Account, right through to the display of full tax invoices. See our section on [Tax](/addons/shop/tax) for important details about dealing with official tax and VAT invoices.
