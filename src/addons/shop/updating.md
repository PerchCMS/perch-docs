Updating the Shop App is usually a case of replacing the four apps used by shop - `perch_shop`, `perch_members`, `perch_products` and `perch_orders` in `perch/addons/apps`. See the [Changelog](/addons/shop/changelog) for details of what has changed between the version you are updating from and the latest.
