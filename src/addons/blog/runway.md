In most cases setting up a blog in Runway is the same as using the application in Perch. The key differences are:

- in Runway you would typically create your pages as Master Pages rather than actual files in the root of your site.
- Runway has routing which will need to be configured for your Blog URLs
- in Runway you have the option of creating multiple blogs
