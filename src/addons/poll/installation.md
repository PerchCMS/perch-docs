Download the latest version of the Poll app checking that the minimum version of Perch is the same or less than the version of Perch that you are running.

Unzip the download where you will find two folders.

-   `poll` – which contains example page
-   `perch_podll` – which is the actual app

Copy the `perch_poll` folder into `perch/addons/apps/`

Add `perch_poll` [to your apps.php file](/docs/installing-perch/installing-apps/).

When you next log into the Perch admin the Poll install script will run behind the scenes to create the necessary tables. A new navigation item will appear in the apps menu.
