The Events app enables you to add date-based events or availability to your site.

Events have a title, date and time, description and one or more configurable categories. Past events can be automatically removed from your site.

Default display modes include a calendar, a monthly listing, as well as a custom function to search and filter events to display them however needed.

As with everything in Perch display is handled via templates (defaults are supplied, which you can copy and edit to make your own) and CSS. So the look and feel is very flexible.
