The Twitter add-on, as of version 4 includes a shortcode provider for embedding tweets into content such as textarea fields.

To use the shortcode, you need the ID of the tweet (found in its URL).

```
[cms:tweet 393001738552504320]
```

This will display the tweet inline at the point the shortcode is entered.
