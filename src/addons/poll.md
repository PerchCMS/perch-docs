The Poll app enables you to add date-based polls to your site.

Polls have questions and answers. Only polls with status Published can be viewed on your site.

As with everything in Perch display is handled via templates (defaults are supplied, which you can copy and edit to make your own) and CSS. So the look and feel is very flexible.
