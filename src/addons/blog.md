The Blog App enables the addition of a blog or news section to your site.

Posts have a title, excerpt, body and date, and can be tagged and added to categories of your choosing. As is usual to Perch you can add custom fields to your templates. Content than then be displayed archived by month and year. An RSS feed of posts can be made available, and content can be filtered by category or tag.

## Use of the Blog App for non-date ordered content

We sometimes see people trying to use the Blog App for things that are not a blog or news listing. This is not usually what you want to do. All of the filtering, sorting and category functionality is available in regular Perch Content. Try using that before attempting to turn Blog into something it isn't!
