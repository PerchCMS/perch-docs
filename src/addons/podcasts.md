The Podcasts app enables you to publish one or more podcast shows from
your site. Podcasts are organized into Shows and Episodes. Each show can
have its own RSS feed, and each show download can be tracked and
reported on.

You can add your own fields to either shows or episodes by editing the
master templates, `show.html` and `episode.html`.
