A brief piece of instructional text that will be displayed before the field appears.

```html
<perch:content type="text" id="start_time" label="Start time" notes-before="Enter the event timings. Be as specific as possible.">
```

This works well when used with [divider-before](/templates/divider-before). You can add a divider with a heading for this group of form fields, then some notes with `notes-before`.
