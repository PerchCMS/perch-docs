- Defines: `<perch:categories></perch:categories>`, `<perch:category></perch:category>`

Category templates can use any Field Types available to other templates in Perch and Runway.

## The `<perch:categories>` tag

Used as a self-closing tag, `perch:categories` will add the Category selection interface to the template when it is displayed in the Perch Control Panel.

```html
<perch:categories id="work" label="Type of work" set="work" required>
```

If you simply want to capture a category selection in order to filter the content then this is all you need to add. If you wish to output a list of categories to the page then you can use the `perch:categories` tag pair with your markup between the opening and closing tags.

```html
<perch:categories id="work" label="Type of work" set="work" required>
  <perch:before>
  <h3>Our work on this project</h3>
  <ul>
  </perch:before>
  <li><a href="/category/<perch:category id="catPath">"><perch:category id="catTitle"></a></li>
  <perch:after>
  </ul>
  </perch:after>
</perch:categories>
```


## Field styles: lists vs checkboxes

By default, categories appear on the edit form as a list from which you can make multiple selections. This is in effect a multiple-item select field, enhanced with JavaScript.

Sometimes you might want to display categories as checkboxes. This works well for simple sets that donâ€™t use nested categories. To do so, add the display-as="checkboxes" attribute.

```html
    <perch:categories id="work" label="Type of work" set="work" required display-as="checkboxes">
```
