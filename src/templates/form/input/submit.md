**Required when using Perch Form** unless using [type="cms"](/templates/form/input/cms).

This creates a submit button. You must have a field of `type="submit"` in your form.

The value of this field becomes the text displayed on the button.

```html
<perch:input type="submit" id="submit" value="Send message">
```
