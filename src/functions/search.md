Search is part of Perch Core functionality and enables you to add a simple text search to your site.

Search can only search content that has been added through Perch and not static pages that you have added. Official apps also register themselves with search so their content will be included.

Perch comes complete with an example search page in the root of the download folder called `search.php`.

Also in the Perch download is a template in `perch/templates/search`. This template has all of the search template fields in it, including paging and can be used as is or you can edit the mark-up as with any Perch template.

To get search working make sure you have the template in your site in `perch/templates/search` then visit search.php in your browser and search for things that appear in your content.
