The Navigation functions give you tools to create Navigation for your site. Some of these functions can also be used outside of Navigation - for example in order to return the current page title to pass into a layout.

In order to create navigation structures Perch needs to know the structure of your site. This is always the case for Perch Runway as the structure is managed through Runway. For Perch this will only the the case if you have Perch Content on the majority of your pages. If you have only made editable a few bits here and there Perch is unlikely to have enough information about your site to do a good job at managing navigation.

The following pages explain how to use the Perch Navigation Functions. You can also find out how to format [navigation templates](/templates/navigation/) in the template reference.
