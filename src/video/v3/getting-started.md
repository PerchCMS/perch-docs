This set of video tutorials aims to take you through the process of building the kind of website typically developed using Perch.

You will be building the site that we use in our Perch Demo. It's a brochure style site that includes a Blog and Forms functionality.

To follow along, download the starting point files and watch the videos as a sequence - of course you can also dip in and just watch the ones covering a particular technique if you already have the basics of Perch under your belt.

Each video, when viewed in this documentation site, has a set of notes which often include copy and paste code. The videos all have captions too.
