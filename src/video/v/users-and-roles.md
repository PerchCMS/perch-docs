## Video Transcript

In this video we can take a look at how Users and Roles work in Perch.

When you install Perch we create a Primary Admin user, this is created with the details you enter when filling in the Setup. The Primary Admin can do everything possible in the control panel. If you go to the Users section of the Control Panel, this user will be listed.

We also create two Roles at setup, the Admin Role and an Editor role. This editor role has limited privileges. Take a look at it by clicking the role name. You can see that by default the user has very limited options.

You can edit the options for that Role here.

When you create new users and give them the Editor role, they will only have the privileges assigned here. If you update any privileges then all users with that role will get them.

You are not limited to the roles that we set up for you. If you go to Roles you can choose to add a role. You can then set up specific privileges.

If you install any of our first party apps, you will find that their permissions also show up here. So you can create a Role just for someone with access to the blog for example.

I'm creating a user with an Editor role.

I then log out and log in as that user. You can see how the Control Panel now reflects the simpler set of options they have. This is one way that Perch helps to make life easier for your clients - you can hide away things to do with site setup, just giving access to the editing tools required.

Logging back in as the Admin.

In addition to setting global privileges on Roles you can set privileges on a Region level, in Region Options. Your preconfigured Roles appear in the list.

Also in Page Options, you can set whether certain Roles can create new subpages..
