## Video Transcript

In a previous video we installed the Forms App, our Swift website also has a blog and for this we will use the official Perch Blog App.

Download the latest version of the Blog add-on, unzip the archive and place the folder perch_blog into perch/addons/apps.

Also in the archive is a folder named blog – this contains some example pages. Drop this into the root of your site.

Open perch/config/apps.php and add a line to include the blog runtime. Save this file and log into Perch, blog will automatically install. Add a couple of categories and posts then visit /blog in your browser. You should see your posts displayed. As we haven’t added any style yet they will look very plain but you should be able to confirm that the blog is working.

Watch the next video and start to customize your blog.
