## Drafts and Preview

When editing content in Perch you can save a Region as a Draft and Preview it before making the content live. 

Edit some content and then, before saving, check the Save as Draft checkbox.

Instead of immediately updating the site the content will be saved as a draft.

A bar at the top will warn you that you are in a draft and give you a button to preview the content. To make the content live just uncheck the Save as Draft button the next time you save the page.
