## Video Transcript

This set of video tutorials will take you through the process of implementing Perch on a website. The website you will be building is one of our [demo sites](https://grabaperch.com/demo) – Swift Migrations – this fictional company website was designed for us by [Laura Kalbag](http://laurakalbag.com/) and at the beginning of our tutorial is simply a set of HTML pages such as you might have on an existing static website or that you have developed during the design process for a site.

You can [download these files](https://static.grabaperch.com/docs/swiftstartingpoint.zip), just as they are here and follow along with the tutorial. The completed – Perched – pages and templates are also available to download on [GitHub](https://github.com/PerchCMS/perchdemo-swift). Of course you can also sign up for a demo to see it in action.

To get started place the HTML files into the root of your website – either on a local or live test server. Then move onto the next video where we will install Perch.
