## The Assets Panel

When you use an image template tag type in Perch this allows your content editors to upload an image, or select from an image already uploaded.

In the Perch Admin, when an image tag is used you get the option to select or upload an image. Clicking this opens the Assets Panel.

You can choose an existing image. Or you can click add asset. Choosing to add an assets opens a drop zone where you can drag and drop images. Or click to browse your filesystem to find your images.

You can search Assets, if I search for balloons I get those images which have titles or tags of balloons.

All of my images are in the default resource bucket. If you have other resource buckets configured you can use those. If you are using Perch Runway then the bucket the images are stored in could be on your Cloud Storage if you have configured Runway to use that.

Once you have selected an asset you can add it to your content. Perch will create any required sizes, as specified in the template for you if they do not already exist.

You can also manage Assets from the main Assets link. This would be a good place to add assets ready for your client to use.

As with the Assets Panel you have a drop zone here to upload images.

If we upload some images, I’ll be able to show you a neat feature. I’ve uploaded my images and these images I have tagged with a title and some Tags in the graphics programme - in my case Adobe Lightroom - I edited the originals in. If we go to edit the image you can see that Perch has pulled in the title and tags. This is really helpful if you have a lot of photography to deal with. Remember that the Asset search uses these titles and tags, so your client will be able to find them easily.

A final note on images and resource cleanup. Perch cleans up images that are not used in content (including your revision history). So once an image falls out of that history stack we’ll clean it up.

To stop that happening check “mark as library asset” then the original asset will never be removed by cleanup and be available for your client to use when they need to. Handy for a library of blog images and so on.
