## Multiple Item Regions

A Perch Region can be set to allow the template to be repeated multiple times. We do this by going to Region Options and selecting Allow multiple items.

You can then go back to your region, and you will be able to add multiple items.

If you set `title` on an element in the template and then go and edit the Region youâ€™ll find that the content entered into that title will be the text you click on when editing in list detail mode.

If you do not want to edit in list detail mode go into Region Options and check Edit all on one page. In this case each item in the template will appear one under the other.

It really depends on the amount of content you are adding which editing method will be most useful. So you can do this on a Region basis to reflect whatever is best for your content.
