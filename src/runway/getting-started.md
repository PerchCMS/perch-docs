This section of the Runway Documentation is your starting point if you are new to Perch Runway or haven't used the product for a while. It includes installation instructions and initial steps to get you started with your project.

As Perch Runway is a superset of Perch functionality you will find that many details, in particular once you are working with templates are the same as Perch. So if you are already familiar with Perch the learning curve is very shallow! Runway typically gives you some extra functionality and options over that available in Perch.
