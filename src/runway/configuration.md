As Perch Runway is built on top of Perch, the basic configuration options remain the same. These can be found in the [Perch Configuration](/perch/configuration/) section.

In addition to this, Perch Runway has a number of configuration settings that are made in its own `config/runway.php` file, including [routing tokens](/runway/routing/custom-tokens/) and [cloud storage settings](/runway/cloud-storage/).
